# Poor Things - A Wild Ride Through Feminism and Frankenstein

Yorgos Lanthimos delivers another eccentric masterpiece with "Poor Things," starring Emma Stone as Bella Baxter, a woman brought back to life through experimental surgery.

## Bold and Unapologetic

This film takes Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and gives it a feminist, absurdist twist. Bella's journey from childlike innocence to intellectual awakening is both hilarious and profound.

## Visual Innovation

- **Color-coded narrative** that shifts with Bella's perspective
- **Practical effects** that are both grotesque and beautiful
- **Production design** that feels like a living organism
- **Cinematography** that matches the story's wild energy

## Themes Explored

The film tackles heavy topics like:
- Female autonomy and bodily rights
- The nature of consciousness and identity
- The absurdity of societal norms
- The ethics of scientific experimentation

## Performances

- **Emma Stone** delivers a career-best performance
- **Mark Ruffalo** is delightfully unhinged
- **Willem Dafoe** brings gravitas to the mad scientist role

## Rating: 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

"Poor Things" is not for everyone - it's weird, challenging, and occasionally uncomfortable. But for those willing to go along for the ride, it's a brilliant exploration of what it means to be human, female, and free.
